# Introduction
This project applies Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the value at risk of crop insurance portfolios, aiming to quantify the financial risk associated with crop production.
In the context of farming, weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms can significantly impact crop yields and, consequently, farm revenues. Crop insurance plays a vital role in mitigating these risks,
but understanding the potential financial exposure is important for setting premiums, managing risk, and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Value at risk, in this case, provides a metric that allows insurance companies and agricultural stakeholders to assess the likelihood of extreme financial losses, enabling better decision-making regarding pricing, risk management,
and reserve requirements. Through this analysis, the project aims to provide insights into the financial stability of crop insurance programs.
